# Basic-JavaScript-Project
A JavaScript project featuring interactive elements like an "Add Friend" button that toggles, a custom "Like" button styled like Instagram's love button, a custom cursor, image hover effects, and Instagram story-like features, all using DOM manipulation to create a dynamic user experience.


**Add Friend Feature With Same Button:
The project at [addfriendbutton.netlify.app](https://addfriendbutton.netlify.app/) features an interactive "Add Friend" button that toggles between "Add" and "Remove" states when clicked. It uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create a dynamic user experience, simulating social media-style friend requests with smooth transitions and visual changes.

**Insta Love Button:
The project at [likebttn.netlify.app](https://likebttn.netlify.app/) is an interactive web page showcasing a customizable "Like" button with a smooth animation effect. It mimics social media like buttons, changing states when clicked, and offers an engaging user experience. The page utilizes JavaScript and DOM manipulation to handle button interactions and visual effects.

**Custom Cursor:
The website "Custom Cursor" (https://customcrsr.netlify.app/) allows users to customize the appearance of their mouse cursor on their website. It offers a variety of pre-made cursor designs and enables users to upload their own custom cursor images. The site provides simple instructions on how to integrate these custom cursors into web projects, making it easy for developers and designers to enhance the user experience with unique, personalized cursor designs.
